The increasing complexity in critical processes provides a perfect environment for serious operational vulnerabilities to hide - until they make themselves visible through a catastrophic crisis. Therefore, OR requires a fundamental change of mindset from preventing to managing. Precautionary measures are undoubtedly important, but at the same time, what we should be emphasising more is the ability to manage the impact when something damaging has already happened. &nbsp;</span></blockquote>
